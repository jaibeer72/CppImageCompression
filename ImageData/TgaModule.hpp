 * Source code
Here is some simple source code tgatest.c that reads a compressed or uncompressed TGA file of either 16, 24, or 32 bit colour and writes an uncompressed version. The primary purpose is to illustrate how the RLE compression works and the implementation of 16 bit extraction.

|        |        |  The offset is determined by the size of the Image         |
|        |        |  Identification Field.  The length is determined by        |
|        |        |  the Color Map Specification, which describes the          |
|        |        |  size of each entry and the number of entries.             |
|        |        |  Each color map entry is 2, 3, or 4 bytes.                 |
|        |        |  Unused bits are assumed to specify attribute bits.        |
|        |        |  The 4 byte entry contains 1 byte for blue, 1 byte         |
|        |        |  for green, 1 byte for red, and 1 byte of attribute        |
|        |        |  information, in that order.                               |
|        |        |  The 3 byte entry contains 1 byte each of blue, green,     |
|        |        |  and red.                                                  |
|        |        |  The 2 byte entry is broken down as follows:               |
|        |        |  ARRRRRGG GGGBBBBB, where each letter represents a bit.    |
|        |        |  But, because of the lo-hi storage order, the first byte   |
|        |        |  coming from the file will actually be GGGBBBBB, and the   |
|        |        |  second will be ARRRRRGG. "A" represents an attribute bit. |

|        |        |  indices.  Each index is stored as an integral number      |
|        |        |  of bytes (typically 1 or 2).   All fields are unsigned.   |

|        |        |  For the run length packet, the header is followed by      |
|        |        |  a single color value, which is assumed to be repeated     |
|        |        |  the number of times specified in the header.  The         |
|        |        |  packet may cross scan lines ( begin on one line and end   |
|        |        |  on the next ).                                            |

|        |        |  the number of color values specified in the header.       |
|        |        |  The color entries themselves are two bytes, three bytes,  |
|        |        |  or four bytes ( for Targa 16, 24, and 32 ), and are       |
|        |        |  broken down as follows:                                   |
|        |        |  The 2 byte entry -                                        |
|        |        |  ARRRRRGG GGGBBBBB, where each letter represents a bit.    |
|        |        |  But, because of the lo-hi storage order, the first byte   |
|        |        |  coming from the file will actually be GGGBBBBB, and the   |
|        |        |  second will be ARRRRRGG. "A" represents an attribute bit. |
|        |        |  The 3 byte entry contains 1 byte each of blue, green,     |
|        |        |  and red.                                                  |
|        |        |  The 4 byte entry contains 1 byte each of blue, green,     |
|        |        |  red, and attribute.  For faster speed (because of the     |
|        |        |  hardware of the Targa board itself), Targa 24 image are   |
|        |        |  sometimes stored as Targa 32 images.                      |
